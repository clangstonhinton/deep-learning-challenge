### Background

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup has requested a neural network machine learning model to it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. A binary classifer was built to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup based on its historical data of more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. 

### Data Description

The data set contains 12 columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:
  - EIN and NAME: Identification columns
  - APPLICATION_TYPE: Alphabet Soup application type
  - AFFILIATION: Affiliated sector of industry
  - CLASSIFICATION: Government organization classification
  - USE_CASE: Use case for funding
  - ORGANIZATION: Organization type
  - STATUS: Active status
  - INCOME_AMT: Income classification
  - SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS: Special considerations for application
  - ASK_AMT: Funding amount requested
  - IS_SUCCESSFUL: Was the money used effectively



### Approach:
Step 1: Preprocess the Data
  - Data Preprocessing
    - What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
    - What variable(s) are the features for your model?
    - What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
  - Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
    - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Step 3: Optimize the Model
  - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
    - What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

Using TensorFlow, the model was optimized to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%. 


## Results

Below are the results of the two logistic regression models deployed in the analysis.
