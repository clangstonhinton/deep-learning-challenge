Background

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, you have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

EIN and NAME—Identification columns

APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type

AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry

CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification

USE_CASE—Use case for funding

ORGANIZATION—Organization type

STATUS—Active status

INCOME_AMT—Income classification

SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application

ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested

IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

Step 1: Preprocess the Data

Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model

Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, you’ll design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup-funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. You’ll need to think about how many inputs there are before determining the number of neurons and layers in your model. Once you’ve completed that step, you’ll compile, train, and evaluate your binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy.

Step 3: Optimize the Model

Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, optimize your model to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%. Use any or all of the following methods to optimize your model:


### The report should contain the following:
1.	Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
2.	Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:
  - Data Preprocessing
    - What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
    - What variable(s) are the features for your model?
    - What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
  - Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
    - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
    - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
    - What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
3.	Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
